# Coap-P2P-Implementation
A project example involving Arduino UNO and the ESP8266-01 Wi-FI module for implementing peer-to-peer communication between microcontrollers. The project is centrally based on the Simple-Coap and the ESP8266Firebase libraries.

## Circuit configuration for uploading the sketch ESP8266 using the Arduino UNO board
[Here](https://www.hackster.io/ROBINTHOMAS/programming-esp8266-esp-01-with-arduino-011389) you can find a short guide on how upload the sketch directly from the Arduino IDE while being connected to the Arduino UNO board.
